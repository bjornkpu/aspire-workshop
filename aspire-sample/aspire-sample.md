# Exploring .NET Aspire Samples

Now that you are familiar with the structure and components of Aspire, let's explore sample projects to understand what you can achieve and how different setups work. We’ll use these samples as practical demonstrations of Aspire’s capabilities.

## Clone the Aspire Samples Repository

To access the official Aspire sample projects, start by cloning the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/dotnet/aspire-samples
```

The samples repository includes various use cases that help demonstrate Aspire's features. You can browse these examples directly from the repository or use Microsoft's **[Samples Browser](https://learn.microsoft.com/samples/browse/?expanded=dotnet&products=dotnet-aspire)** for more details.

## Locate the Samples

Once cloned, the sample projects can be found within the repository at:

```
aspire-samples/samples
```

Each sample project showcases a specific aspect of Aspire's capabilities, from frontend integration to the Aspire dashboard. We'll focus on the following samples:

1. **[Integrating frontend apps using React, Vue, Angular, etc.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/dotnet/aspire-samples/aspire-angular-react-vue/)**  
   Learn how to seamlessly integrate Single Page Applications (SPAs) like React, Vue, or Angular with Aspire.

2. **[Standalone Aspire Dashboard](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/dotnet/aspire-samples/aspire-standalone-dashboard/)**  
   Explore how to work with the Aspire Dashboard to monitor and debug system operations.

3. **[.NET Aspire Shop](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/dotnet/aspire-samples/aspire-shop/)**  
   A more complex sample showcasing Aspire in an e-commerce setting with advanced use cases.


## Follow Along with the Workshop

We’ll dive into each of these samples, starting with **Single Page Applications (SPAs)**. Each example will highlight key features and configurations relevant for integrating and building distributed systems with Aspire.

Let’s get started!
